Architecture: ${pkg:Arch}
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: MSCCL scheduler selects optimal MSCCL algorithms for MSCCL executors. 
 It implements a static algorithm selection policy. Given a folder containing
 MSCCL algorithm files and collective operation requirements, this scheduler
 picks proper algorithms by matching different applicable conditions, including
 collective operation type, message size range, in-place or out-of-place, scale
 , etc.
